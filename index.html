                    Hi! My name is Liram Spector, I’m 16 and from Rishon Lezion, Israel. 
                    These days, I’m in the middle of a five-year adventure studying computer science — 2 years down, 3 more to go (but who’s counting?). 
                    When I’m not buried in code, you’ll probably find me traveling or listening to music. 
                    I’m a bit of a perfectionist, endlessly curious, and I like to think I’m pretty funny, kind, and of course, super humble!
